# dotfiles
My dotfiles for the debian laptop I daily use.

It's a work in progress as I learn more and more about Linux systems.

## Software I used
- Window manager: **i3**
- Bar: **i3blocks**
- Menu: **rofi**
- Terminal: **kitty**
- Composer: **picom**
- Background: **feh**
- Theme: **gruvbox**

## What is in this directory
- i3: main config file for `i3`
- i3blocks: main config gile for `i3blocks` and scripts
- kitty: main config file and theme for `kitty`
- rofi: main config file and theme for `rofi`
- wallpapers: folder for wallpapers


## How to use it
- color variables accessed by `i3` are stored in `.Xresources`
- other variables accessed by scripts are stored in `.profile` 

## To Do
- [ ] personalize system notification
- [ ] personalize rofi and kitty themes
